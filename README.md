## Instructions

1. Place the script in the root folder of your OMSI installation, e.g., `X:\OMSI 2 Steam Edition` or `X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\OMSI 2`.
2. Create a text file named `file_paths.txt` (or a different name, which can be changed inside the script) and add the filenames of the scenery objects and splines you want to pack.  
   *Note:* To pack a whole folder, end the file path with `\*`.
3. Run the script.
4. You will receive a ZIP file and a `did not find.txt` file listing any missing files.
5. TLDR: Just download the exe: [Download OMSI Missing Files Packer UI](https://github.com/KF8311/OMSI-FilePacker-UI/blob/48a2391181d22896f53f129aef050ca026911a18/dist/OMSI%20Missing%20Files%20Packer%20UI.exe)
